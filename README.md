# NUS Sumobot Team
## Welcome to NUS Sumobot Repository!
## 1. Introduction

Additional Google Doc Documentation https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GuzY8P-FfNIKnv2RRr8Z_rRWyYxQeD7UvBhbVNG4xBk/edit?usp=sharing

This is a repository for the development of the Sumo Robot by NUS Robomaster DarkNUS team (Winter 2020). In here, you will find the code for Computer Vision, Microcontroller (eg. Arduino, Rasberrypi, ...) and all the design and iteration of the Sumo Robot.

We will also use this repo to track our general development progress by indicating the completion status of each team and aspects which the team are working on in this repository.

## 2. Development Tools (EE & CV)
### Visual Studio Code
VSCode is a lightweight and highly functional text editor and pseudo-IDE which is recommended for this project. You can find the installation guide here:
> [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### PlatformIO
After you finish installing VSCode, navigate into the extension tab and download **PlatformIO extension**. This extension allow us to compile and run code for different type of microcontroller such as Arduino and RasberryPi from VSCode itself. Yep that is right **no more separate Arduino IDE or RasberryPi IDE**. **One platform to rule them all !!!** Furthermore, PlatformIO will make integration with Git easire and can help improve workflow and code management. You can read more on 
> [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)

### Git & Github
Collaboration in programming world would be impossible without one of mankind greatest invention **Git**. Git is a Source Code Management
It is necessary that all members are familiar with how to use **Git and Github** to do basic code management such as commit, pull, and push. You can find out how to install Git here:
> [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

On the same website, there is also a [book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for indepth exploration of what **Git** can do (TLDR: it can do **A LOT** of thing). Here is a joke for you: 
> How do you win a programming competition?
>  
> You need to "Git good"

For those who are starting out and a bit clueless about Git or those who already know what is Git but have trouble navigating around, here is some resources for you all:
* [Harvard Git Lecture](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/weeks/1/) 
  ( **WARNING**: It is 1 hour of good content that is more useful than your usual 2 hours lecture )
* [Github & Git cheatsheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

PS: although Github make life easier by putting GUI so you don't have to use CLI to execute Git command, I still recommend you to use Bash as it will let you understand Git better and you can easily do more complex stuff in the future.
### Huy's personal recommendation (for an easier and stress free life)
You might want to download the following extensions on your VSCode (from the extension tab) which can do a lot of cool stuffs (eg. auto complete, header finding, intellisense, ...) that help manage your workflow and monitor other workflow, just type the key words as you see bellow:
* Git History
* GitLens
* C/C++
* Python
  
### Markdown
Want to know how I make this cool document? I written it in a markup language called Mardown (yeah I know ironically). You can find more information about it here:
> [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

If you decide to pick up this cool documentation language and want to help with documenting, you can also download this following extensions in VSCode:
* Markdown preview
* Mardown All in One

## 3. Development Tools (ME)
I have no idea, so I will just put **To Be Continue**

## 4. Timeline & Progress
The specific detail on how we want to organize ourselves and our works will be dicussed at a later date.
